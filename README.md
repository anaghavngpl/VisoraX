# VisoraX
VisoraX is a full‑stack web AI project that detects hazardous windshield glare from dashcam images, combining a React + Vite frontend (drag‑and‑drop upload, live preview, animated UI) with a Flask API that fuses YOLOv8 cues and classic CV (HSV, gradients, center‑focus) to return a composite alert level, confidence, and processing time.
